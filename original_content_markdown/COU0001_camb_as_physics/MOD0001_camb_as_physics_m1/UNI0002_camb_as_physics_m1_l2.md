## INTRODUCTION

Physical quantities are a characteristic or properties of an object that can be measured or calculated from other measurements. Scientists often make measurements. These need to be stated with the units of the quantity being measured, and the accuracy of the measurements. In the last unit we explored the different physical quantities and their SI units. In this unit we explore how these SI units are derived.

<!-- SECTION: LEARNING-OBJECTIVES -->

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this unit you should be able to:

1.  Express derived units as products or quotients of the SI base units and use the derived units for quantities.
2.  Use SI base units to check the homogeneity of physical equations.
3.  Recall and use prefixes and their symbols to indicate decimal submultiples or multiples of both base and derived units.

## TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

**Prefix** - A specifier that is prepended to units of measurement to indicate multiples or fractions of the units.

**Standard form** - A system in which numbers are written as a number greater than 1 and less than 10 multiplied by a power of 10 which may be positive or negative.

**Derived Units** - Units that are formed from a combination of one or more S.I. base units.

**Homogenous equation** - An equation which when expressed in base units has the same units throughout, as separated by +, - and = signs.

# 1. Derived Units

All other units that are not S.I. units can be expressed as a combination of one or more base units.

For example, velocity is defined as the rate of change of displacement = Δs/Δt. Therefore, the unit of velocity is the unit of displacement divided by the unit for time = m/s.

Another derived quantity is Force, whose derived unit is the Newton.

F = mass x acceleration
N = kg x m s⁻²
N = kg m s⁻²

## 1.1 Pascals in S.I. base units

Pressure can be calculated by the following equation:

P = F/A

*pressure = Force / Area* or

*   Force = mass x acceleration, so the base units for force is kg m s⁻².
*   The base unit for area is m².
*   So, pressure has base units kg m s⁻² / m².
*   Simplified, this is kg m⁻¹ s⁻².

## 1.2 Density

Density can be calculated by the following equation:

*density = mass / volume*

*   The base unit for mass is kg.
*   The base unit for volume is m³.
*   So, density has base units kg / m³ or kg m⁻³.

# 2. Homogeneous Equations

When each term in an equation, as separated by +, - or = has the same base units, the equation is said to be homogeneous.

To check the homogeneity of physical equations, you can follow these steps:

1.  Check the units on both sides of the equation.
2.  Determine if they are similar.
3.  If they do not match, the equation is inhomogeneous or heterogenous.

To further understand the concept of homogeneity, please follow this link to a short video.

**NOTE:** Digit coefficients are unitless and do not contribute to the units of measurement.

# 3. Prefixes

You will come across very small and very large numbers throughout your Physics journey. This can be pretty confusing and problematic. Numbers are written using the powers of 10 to make them less awkward. This is known as scientific notation or standard form. For example:

3 700 000 000 000 m = 3.7 × 10¹² m or
0.0000037 s = 3.7 × 10⁻⁶ s

Each SI unit has multiples and submultiples to avoid using very high or low numbers. We use prefixes as an abbreviation for some of the powers of 10. For example, the height of a mountain is 6200 m, but it may be written as 6.2 × 10³ m or 6.2 km. The prefix comes before the unit (e.g. kilometre, milligrams, etc.). For example:

3 700 000 000 000 m = 3.7 × 10¹² m = 3.7 terametres = 3.7 Tm
0.0000037 s = 3.7 × 10⁻⁶ s = 3.7 microseconds = 3.7 µs

The table below shows the most often used prefixes:

| Prefix | Symbol | Value  |
| :----- | :----- | :----- |
| pico   | p      | 10⁻¹²  |
| nano   | n      | 10⁻⁹   |
| micro  | μ      | 10⁻⁶   |
| milli  | m      | 10⁻³   |
| centi  | c      | 10⁻²   |
| deci   | d      | 10⁻¹   |
| kilo   | k      | 10³    |
| mega   | M      | 10⁶    |
| giga   | G      | 10⁹    |
| tera   | T      | 10¹²   |

## EXAM-STYLE QUESTIONS

Consider the EXAM-STYLE QUESTION below. After reflecting on this question, follow the instructions provided by your platform to reveal the suggested answer/explanation.

**Question 1:**
The drag force F subscript D acting on a car moving with speed v along a straight horizontal road is given by
F subscript D = v²Ak
where k is a constant and A is the cross-sectional area of the car.
Determine the SI base units of k.
[2]

**Explanation (Derived from feedback/explanation on page 11):**
Given the equation: F subscript D = v²Ak
The base units of the terms are:
F subscript D: N (Newton), which in base units is kg m s⁻² (Force = mass x acceleration)
v: m s⁻¹
A: m²

Substitute the base units into the equation:
kg m s⁻² = (m s⁻¹)² x m² x k
kg m s⁻² = m² s⁻² x m² x k
kg m s⁻² = m⁴ s⁻² k

To find the base units of k, rearrange the equation:
k = (kg m s⁻²) / (m⁴ s⁻²)
k = kg m¹⁻⁴ s⁻²⁻⁽⁻²⁾
k = kg m⁻³ s⁰
k = kg m⁻³

In order to make the equation homogenous, we assign kg m⁻³ to k.
**Answer:** kg m⁻³

**Question 2:**
A unit may be stated with a prefix that represents a power-of-ten multiple or submultiple.
Complete Table 1.1 to show the name and symbol of each prefix and the corresponding power-of-ten multiple or submultiple.
[2]

**Table 1.1**

| prefix      | power-of-ten multiple or submultiple |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------- |
| kilo (k)    | 10³                                  |
| tera (T)    | 10¹²                                 |
| pico (p)    | 10⁻¹²                                | *(Completed from information on page 9/11)*

**Answer:** The completed table includes: tera (T) for 10¹² and pico (p) for 10⁻¹².

You must be careful when using prefixes, especially when it comes to squaring or cubing prefixes.

For example:

*   1 mm = 10⁻³ m, so 1 mm² = (10⁻³ m)² which equals 10⁻⁶ m².
*   Similarly, 1 mm³ = (10⁻³ m)³ which equals 10⁻⁹ m³.

**Example:**

The density of water is approx. 1.0 g cm⁻³. Calculate this value in kg m⁻³.
Firstly, you have to find the conversions for the units:

1 g = 1 x 10⁻³ kg
1 cm³ = 1 × (10⁻² m)³ = 1 × 10⁻⁶ m³ *(Corrected calculation for cm³ conversion)*

Then, you use these in the value for the density of water:

1.0 g cm⁻³ = 1.0 × (1 × 10⁻³ kg) / (1 × 10⁻⁶ m³)
= 1.0 × 10⁻³ / 10⁻⁶ kg m⁻³
= 1.0 × 10³ kg m⁻³
