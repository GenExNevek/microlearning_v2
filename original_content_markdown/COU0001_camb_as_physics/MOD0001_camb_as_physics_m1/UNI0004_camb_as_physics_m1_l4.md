# AS | Physics - 9702 - 1.4 Scalars and Vectors

## INTRODUCTION

As we have been learning, physical quantities are a characteristic or properties of an object that can be measured or calculated from other measurements. Scientists often make measurements. These need to be stated with the units of the quantity being measured, and the accuracy of the measurements. In this unit we will learn about scalars and vectors.

<!-- SECTION: LEARNING-OBJECTIVES -->

## TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

**Scalars** - A scalar quantity can be described fully by stating its magnitude (size) only eg mass of a rock.

**Vector** - A vector quantity can be described fully by stating its magnitude (size) and direction eg force of gravity.

<!-- SECTION: MAIN-CONTENT-AREA -->

## 1. Difference Between Scalar and Vector Quantities

A **scalar** is a quantity that only has a magnitude or size. For examples: distance, speed, mass, time, energy, volume, density, pressure, electric charge and temperature.

A **vector** is a quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction. For examples: displacement, velocity, acceleration, force and momentum.

If we look at the example of a person walking in the woods, the distance travelled will be a scalar quantity because it describes how far an object has travelled, but it does not indicate the direction the person travelled in. For example: the person has walked 10 km.

However, the displacement is described as 10 km north. Therefore, displacement is a vector quantity because it describes how far the person has walked and in which direction.

## 2. Combining Vectors

We represent vectors by an arrow. The arrowhead shows the direction of the vector, while the length of the arrow represents its magnitude.

We can combine vectors by adding or subtracting them, and two methods can be used to combine vectors. When two or more vectors are combined into a single vector, the single vector is known as the resultant vector.

## 2.1 The triangle method

To combine vectors using the triangle method, you follow these 2 steps:

1.  Link the vectors head-to-tail.
2.  The resultant force is formed by connecting the first vector's tail to the second vector's head.

*Note: The original content included interactive steps which demonstrated this process.*

**EXAMPLE**

Draw the vector c = a + b

![Image showing vectors a and b](./UNI0004_camb_as_physics_m1_l4-img-assets/fig1-page6-img1.png)
*Description: Vectors a and b are shown as arrows pointing in different directions.*

**Process: Adding vectors a and b using the triangle method**
1.  **Link the vectors head-to-tail:** Translate vector b such that its tail is in contact with the head of vector a. Do not change the direction of b, simply shift (translate) it.
    ![Image showing vector a with vector b linked head-to-tail](./UNI0004_camb_as_physics_m1_l4-img-assets/fig2-page7-img1.png)
    *Description: Vector a is shown, and vector b has been moved so its tail starts at the head of vector a.*
2.  **Form the resultant vector by linking the tail of a to the head of b:** Create the Resultant vector, which is the 3rd side of the triangle by putting its tail at the starting point of the sequence of a and b, and its head at the end point.
    ![Image showing the resultant vector c forming a triangle with vectors a and b](./UNI0004_camb_as_physics_m1_l4-img-assets/fig3-page8-img1.png)
    *Description: Vectors a and b are shown linked head-to-tail. A third vector, c, is drawn from the tail of a to the head of b, forming a triangle. c is labeled as c = a + b.*

**EXAMPLE**

Draw the vector c = a - b

![Image showing vectors a and b](./UNI0004_camb_as_physics_m1_l4-img-assets/fig4-page9-img1.png)
*Description: Vectors a and b are shown as arrows pointing in different directions.*

Note: Subtracting vectors requires you to first reverse the direction of vector b to make -b.

**Process: Subtracting vector b from vector a using the triangle method**
1.  **Create -b:** Reverse the direction of vector b while keeping its magnitude the same.
    ![Image showing vector -b (reversed b)](./UNI0004_camb_as_physics_m1_l4-img-assets/fig5-page10-img1.png)
    *Description: Vector b is shown with its direction reversed, labeled -b.*
2.  **Link the vectors head-to-tail:** Link vector a and vector -b head-to-tail.
    ![Image showing vector a with vector -b linked head-to-tail](./UNI0004_camb_as_physics_m1_l4-img-assets/fig6-page11-img1.png)
    *Description: Vector a is shown, and vector -b has been moved so its tail starts at the head of vector a.*
3.  **Form the resultant vector by linking the tail of a to the head of -b:**
    ![Image showing the resultant vector c=a-b forming a triangle with a and -b](./UNI0004_camb_as_physics_m1_l4-img-assets/fig7-page13-img1.png)
    *Description: Vectors a and -b are shown linked head-to-tail. A third vector, c, is drawn from the tail of a to the head of -b, forming a triangle. c is labeled as c = a - b.*

The Resultant is usually signified by double arrows.

To calculate the Resultant force using the triangle method, you can either use Pythagoras theorem, for a right-angled triangle or trigonometric ratios. Vectors at this stage are seldom drawn to scale.

## 2.2 The parallelogram method

To combine vectors using the parallelogram method, you follow these 3 steps:

1.  Link the vectors tail-to-tail.
2.  Complete the resulting parallelogram.
3.  The diagonal of the parallelogram will be the resultant vector.

*Note: The original content included interactive steps which demonstrated this process.*

**EXAMPLE**

Draw the vector c = a + b.

![Image showing vectors a and b](./UNI0004_camb_as_physics_m1_l4-img-assets/fig8-page14-img1.png)
*Description: Vectors a and b are shown as arrows pointing in different directions.*

**Process: Adding vectors a and b using the parallelogram method**
1.  **Link the vectors tail-to-tail:** Translate vector b such that its tail is in contact with the tail of vector a.
    ![Image showing vectors a and b linked tail-to-tail](./UNI0004_camb_as_physics_m1_l4-img-assets/fig9-page15-img1.png)
    *Description: Vector a is shown, and vector b has been moved so its tail starts at the tail of vector a.*
2.  **Complete the resulting parallelogram:** Complete the parallelogram by drawing dashed lines that are parallel to vectors a and b.
    ![Image showing the parallelogram formed by vectors a and b](./UNI0004_camb_as_physics_m1_l4-img-assets/fig10-page16-img1.png)
    *Description: Vectors a and b are linked tail-to-tail. Dashed lines are drawn parallel to a and b to complete a parallelogram.*
3.  **The resultant vector is the diagonal of the parallelogram:** Draw a diagonal as shown.
    ![Image showing the resultant vector c as the diagonal of the parallelogram](./UNI0004_camb_as_physics_m1_l4-img-assets/fig11-page17-img1.png)
    *Description: Vectors a and b are linked tail-to-tail, forming a parallelogram with dashed lines. A vector c is drawn as the diagonal from the shared tail of a and b to the opposite corner of the parallelogram. c is labeled c = a + b.*

**EXAMPLE**

Draw the vector c = a - b

![Image showing vectors a and b](./UNI0004_camb_as_physics_m1_l4-img-assets/fig12-page18-img1.png)
*Description: Vectors a and b are shown as arrows pointing in different directions.*

Note: Subtracting vectors, require you to first reverse the direct of vector b to make -b.

**Process: Subtracting vector b from vector a using the parallelogram method**
1.  **Create -b:** Reverse the direction of vector b while keeping its magnitude the same.
    ![Image showing vector -b (reversed b)](./UNI0004_camb_as_physics_m1_l4-img-assets/fig13-page19-img1.png)
    *Description: Vector b is shown with its direction reversed, labeled -b.*
2.  **Link the vectors tail-to-tail:** Link vector a and vector -b tail-to-tail.
    ![Image showing vector a and vector -b linked tail-to-tail](./UNI0004_camb_as_physics_m1_l4-img-assets/fig14-page20-img1.png)
    *Description: Vector a is shown, and vector -b has been moved so its tail starts at the tail of vector a.*
3.  **Complete the resulting parallelogram:** Complete the parallelogram formed by a and -b.
    ![Image showing the parallelogram formed by vectors a and -b](./UNI0004_camb_as_physics_m1_l4-img-assets/fig15-page20-img2.png)
    *Description: Vectors a and -b are linked tail-to-tail. Dashed lines are drawn parallel to a and -b to complete a parallelogram.*
4.  **The resultant vector is the diagonal of the parallelogram:** Draw the diagonal from the shared tail of a and -b.
    ![Image showing the resultant vector c=a-b as the diagonal of the parallelogram](./UNI0004_camb_as_physics_m1_l4-img-assets/fig16-page20-img3.png)
    *Description: Vectors a and -b are linked tail-to-tail, forming a parallelogram. A vector c is drawn as the diagonal from the shared tail of a and -b to the opposite corner. c is labeled c = a - b.*

## EXAM STYLE QUESTIONS

The following question is an exam style question on the Paper 1, multiple choice exam. Before reading the feedback and the explanation, try the question yourself and make sure you also understand the reason for not selecting the incorrect options.

**Exam Style Question 1:**
**Question:** Two forces of equal magnitude are represented by two coplanar vectors. One is directed towards the east and the other is directed towards the north. In which direction will the resultant force be in?
**Options:**
A. towards the north-east
B. towards the north-west
C. towards the south-east
D. towards the south-west

**Feedback:**
1. A

**Explanation:**
1. The two vectors can be illustrated as shown below. Either a triangle of vectors can be drawn or a parallelogram can be drawn and the diagonal will be the resultant. The resultant force is in the North East.
![Diagram showing a vector pointing East and a vector pointing North, originating from the same point.](./UNI0004_camb_as_physics_m1_l4-img-assets/fig17-page22-img1.png)
*Description: A diagram shows axes with North (N) and East (E) indicated. An arrow points right along the East axis, and an arrow points up along the North axis, both starting from the origin.*

Consider the EXAM-STYLE QUESTION below. After reflecting on this question, click the FEEDBACK and EXPLANATION tabs to reveal the suggested answer.

**Exam Style Question 2:**
**Question:** Complete the table below by putting a tick (√) in the appropriate column to indicate whether the listed quantities are scalars or vectors.

| quantity     | scalar | vector |
| :----------- | :----- | :----- |
| acceleration |        |        |
| density      |        |        |
| temperature  |        |        |
| momentum     |        |        |

**Feedback:**
1. Scalars: density, temperature
   Vectors: acceleration, momentum

**Explanation:**
1. Acceleration and momentum have both magnitude and direction. Density and temperature have magnitude only.

## 3. Resolving Vectors

Coplanar forces are forces that act in the same plane eg a vertical plane. Coplanar forces may act from a single point. When 3 co-planar forces acting from the same point can form a closed triangle, then they are in equilibrium.

For example:

![Diagram showing three forces F1, F2, F3 acting from a point, and an equivalent triangle formed by these forces](./UNI0004_camb_as_physics_m1_l4-img-assets/fig18-page22-img2.png)
*Description: On the left, three vectors F1, F2, F3 originate from a single point, representing forces in equilibrium. F1 is 4N horizontally, F2 is 3N vertically, and F3 is 5N angled upwards and left. On the right, these vectors are shown forming a closed right-angled triangle, demonstrating the condition for equilibrium.*

A resultant vector can be resolved and represented by two vectors which in combination have the same effect as the original one. The parts which a single resultant vector can be broken into are called its **components**.

For example, the vector below (red) has a magnitude of A and is at an angle of θ to the horizontal. You can resolve this vector into its horizontal and vertical components using trigonometry.

For the horizontal component, Aₓ = Acosθ and for the vertical component, Ay = Asinθ.

![Diagram showing a vector A resolved into horizontal (Ax) and vertical (Ay) components](./UNI0004_camb_as_physics_m1_l4-img-assets/fig19-page22-img3.png)
*Description: A vector A is shown originating from the origin at an angle θ to the horizontal axis (x-axis). A right-angled triangle is formed with A as the hypotenuse. The horizontal side along the x-axis is labeled Aₓ and the vertical side along the y-axis is labeled Ay.*
