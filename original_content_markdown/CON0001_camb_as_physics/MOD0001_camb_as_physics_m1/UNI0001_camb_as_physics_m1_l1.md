# AS | Physics - 9702 - 1.1 Physical Quantities

## INTRODUCTION

A physical quantity is one that can be measured or calculated from other measurements. Scientists often make measurements. These need to be stated with the units of the quantity being measured, and how accurate the measurements are. We will explore the different physical quantities and their SI units in this unit.

<!-- SECTION: LEARNING-OBJECTIVES -->

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this unit you should be able to:

1.  Understand that all physical quantities consist of a numerical magnitude and a unit.
2.  Make reasonable estimates of physical quantities included within the syllabus.
3.  Recall the following SI base quantities and their units: mass (kg), length (m), time (s), current (A) and temperature (K).

*   **Physical quantity** - Any measurable quantity
*   **Unit** - The scale to which a measurement is compared

## 1. Physical Quantities

Making measurements is very important in physics. Without numerical measurements, we would have to rely on descriptions, and this could lead to inaccurate comparisons. We would not be able to build a building if the instructions were just 'big' or 'small'.

When making these measurements, physicists use different instruments for different physical quantities and take special care to make these measurements as accurate as possible. For any measurement, the unit being used must be stated to give an understanding of the scale of the measurement.

A **physical quantity** is one that can be measured: for example, mass.

All physical quantities consist of:

*   a numerical magnitude (size)
*   the unit in which it was measured.

Letters are used to represent these physical quantities. For example, the letter 'm' is used to represent mass. The units provide the context of how much of 'm' is being referred to: for example, 60 g and 60 kg are two very different quantities.

Here is an example of how to express a physical quantity in terms of both the numerical size and unit:

*   Mass of an adult woman = 65 kg

A physical quantity is measurable. Units are the scale of measurement. Having units is essential in our everyday life.

There is a seemingly endless number of units in physics, but the **SI system** called the **Système Internationale d'Unités** brings some order to units. It is an internationally agreed-upon system of units which consists of base units that are carefully defined and allow us to compare other measurements against them.

## 2. SI Units

| Physical quantity    | Unit       | Typical symbol |
| :------------------- | :--------- | :------------- |
| mass                 | kilogram   | kg             |
| length               | metre      | m              |
| time                 | second     | s              |
| temperature          | kelvin     | K              |
| electric current     | ampere     | A              |
| amount of substance  | mole       | mol            |
| luminous intensity   | candela    | cd             |

[Note, you are not required to use the candela in this section.]

All other units can be **derived** from the seven base units. For example:

*   Volume is measured in cubic metres (m³)
*   Density is measured in kilograms per cubic metre (kg m¯³)
*   Velocity is measured in metres per second (m s¯¹)

Please remember to leave a small space between them when writing units. Leaving out the space might lead to using an incorrect unit. For example, you need to write the unit for speed as 3 m s¯¹. If you write it as 3 ms¯¹, it would mean 3 millisecond¯¹.

## 3. Estimating Physical Quantities

When you carry out an experiment or a calculation, it is sensible to look at the answer to see if it seems **reasonable**. For example, you might want to recheck your answer if you find that the speed of a car is 900 km/s! To do this, you need to be aware of some **basic benchmarks**. The following tables give some real quantities in everyday life and knowledge of these will help you to make reasonable **estimates**.

| Quantity                 | Estimate         |
| :----------------------- | :--------------- |
| Mass of sun              | 2 × 10³⁰ kg      |
| Mass of Earth            | 6 x 10²⁴ kg      |
| Mass of moon             | 7 x 10²² kg      |
| Mass of an elephant      | 2 × 10⁶ kg       |
| Mass of a football       | 4 x 10⁻¹ m       |
| Length of a car          | 2 m              |

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

*   A physical quantity is something that can be measured: for example, time.
*   Units are used to give an understanding of the scale of the measurement.
*   Scientists use standardised units called SI units.
*   A scientist is expected to be able to make reasonable estimates of quantities.

<!-- SECTION: KNOWLEDGE-CHECK -->

## KNOWLEDGE CHECK

**Activity 1:** Let's start by seeing whether you can estimate some quantities with their most relevant size. Match the object with the most applicable estimation:

*   The wavelength of UV light: 10 nm
*   Height of an adult human: 2 m
*   Distance between the Earth and the sun: 1.5 × 10⁸ m
*   Mass of a hydrogen atom: 10⁻²⁷ kg
*   Mass of an adult human: 70 kg
*   Power of a lightbulb: 60 W
*   Atmospheric pressure: 1 × 10⁵ Pa
*   Seconds in a day: 90 000 s
*   Speed of sound in air: 3 × 10⁷ m s⁻¹
    *(Note: The provided estimate for the speed of sound in air (3 x 10⁷ m s⁻¹) appears to be incorrect based on typical values (~343 m/s = 3.43 x 10² m/s). This pairing reflects the relationship shown in the source material.)*

**Question 2:** Which of the following is an SI base unit?
**Options:**
- current
- gram
- Kelvin
- volt
**Answer:** Kelvin
**Explanation:** The SI base units include the kilogram (for mass), metre (for length), second (for time), ampere (for electric current), kelvin (for temperature), mole (for amount of substance), and candela (for luminous intensity). Gram is a unit of mass, but kilogram is the base unit. Current is a physical quantity, not a unit (ampere is the unit). Volt is a derived unit.

**Question 3:** Five energies are listed below:
*   5 kJ
*   5 mJ
*   5 MJ
*   5 nJ

Starting with the smallest first, what is the order of increasing magnitude of these energies?
**Options:**
- 5 kJ → 5 mJ → 5 MJ → 5 nJ
- k nJ → 5 kJ → 5 MJ → 5 mJ
- 5 nJ → 5 mJ → 5 kJ → 5 MJ
- 5 mJ → 5 nJ → 5 kJ → 5 MJ
**Answer:** 5 nJ → 5 mJ → 5 kJ → 5 MJ
**Explanation:** Convert to a common unit, Joules (J): 5 nJ = 5 x 10⁻⁹ J, 5 mJ = 5 x 10⁻³ J, 5 kJ = 5 x 10³ J, 5 MJ = 5 x 10⁶ J. Ordering by magnitude (10⁻⁹, 10⁻³, 10³, 10⁶) gives nJ, mJ, kJ, MJ.

**Question 4:** What is a reasonable estimate of the average gravitational force acting on a fully grown woman standing on the Earth?
**Options:**
- 60 N
- 250 N
- 350 N
- 650 N
**Answer:** 650 N
**Explanation:** A reasonable mass for an adult human is around 70 kg (as estimated in Activity 1). The gravitational force (weight) is given by F = mg, where g ≈ 9.8 m/s². F ≈ 70 kg * 9.8 m/s² ≈ 686 N. 650 N is the closest option to this value.

**Question 5:** Which statement includes a correct unit?
**Options:**
- energy = 7.8 N s
- force = 3.8 N s
- momentum = 6.2 N s
- torque = 4.7 N s
**Answer:** momentum = 6.2 N s
**Explanation:** The unit for energy is Joules (J = N m). The unit for force is Newtons (N). The unit for momentum is kg m/s, which is equivalent to N s (since Force = rate of change of momentum, F = Δp/Δt, so Δp = F Δt, and the unit is N s). The unit for torque is Newton-metres (N m).

**Question 6:** For which quantity is the magnitude a reasonable estimate?
**Options:**
- frequency of a radio wave 500 pHz
- mass of an atom 500 µg
- the Young's modulus of a metal 500 kPa
- wavelength of green light 500 nm
**Answer:** wavelength of green light 500 nm
**Explanation:** Radio wave frequencies are typically in MHz or GHz. 500 pHz (picoHertz, 10⁻¹² Hz) is far too low. The mass of an atom is on the order of 10⁻²⁶ or 10⁻²⁵ kg (10⁻²³ or 10⁻²² g), so 500 µg (500 x 10⁻⁶ g) is vastly too large. Young's modulus for metals is typically in the GPa range (10⁹ Pa), so 500 kPa (500 x 10³ Pa) is far too low. The wavelength of visible light is around 400-700 nm; green light is typically around 500-550 nm. 500 nm is a reasonable estimate.
