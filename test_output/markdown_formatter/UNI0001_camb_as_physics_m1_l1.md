<!-- SECTION: INTRODUCTION -->

## INTRODUCTION
A physical quantity is one that can be measured or calculated from other measurements. Scientists often make measurements. These need to be stated with the units of the quantity being measured, and how accurate the measurements are. We will explore the different physical quantities and their SI units in this unit.

# Physical Quantities and SI Units

## 1. Physical Quantities
Making measurements is very important in physics. Without numerical measurements, we would have to rely on descriptions, and this could lead to inaccurate comparisons. We would not be able to build a building if the instructions were just 'big' or 'small'.

When making these measurements, physicists use different instruments for different physical quantities and take special care to make these measurements as accurate as possible. For any measurement, the unit being used must be stated to give an understanding of the scale of the measurement.

A physical quantity is one that can be measured: for example, mass.

All physical quantities consist of:
*   a numerical magnitude (size)
*   the unit in which it was measured.

Letters are used to represent these physical quantities. For example, the letter 'm' is used to represent mass. The units provide the context of how much of 'm' is being referred to: for example, 60 g and 60 kg are two very different quantities. The flashcard below is an example of how to express a physical quantity in terms of both the numerical size and unit.

Mass of an adult woman m = 65 kg

A physical quantity is measurable. Units are the **scale of measurement**. Having units is essential in our everyday life.

There is a seemingly endless number of units in physics, but the **SI system** called the Système Internationale d'Unités brings some order to units. It is an internationally agreed-upon system of units which consists of base units that are carefully defined and allow us to compare other measurements against them.

## 2. SI Units
| Physical quantity     | Unit     | Typical symbol |
| :-------------------- | :------- | :------------- |
| mass                  | kilogram | kg             |
| length                | metre    | m              |
| time                  | second   | s              |
| temperature           | kelvin   | K              |
| electric current      | ampere   | A              |
| amount of substance   | mole     | mol            |
| luminous intensity    | candela  | cd             |

[Note, you are not required to use the candela in this section.]

All other units can be **derived** from the seven base units. For example:
*   Volume is measured in cubic metres (m³)
*   Density is measured in kilograms per cubic metre (kg m⁻³)
*   Velocity is measured in metres per second (m s⁻¹)

Please remember to leave a small space between them when writing units. Leaving out the space might lead to using an incorrect unit. For example, you need to write the unit for speed as 3 m s⁻¹. If you write it as 3 ms⁻¹, it would mean 3 millisecond⁻¹.

## 3. Estimating Physical Quantities
When you carry out an experiment or a calculation, it is sensible to look at the answer to see if it seems **reasonable**. For example, you might want to recheck your answer if you find that the speed of a car is 900 km/s! To do this, you need to be aware of some **basic benchmarks**. The following tables give some real quantities in everyday life and knowledge of these will help you to make reasonable **estimates**.

| Quantity              | Estimate          |
| :-------------------- | :---------------- |
| Mass of sun           | 2 × 10³⁰ kg       |
| Mass of Earth         | 6 × 10²⁴ kg       |
| Mass of moon          | 7 × 10²² kg       |
| Mass of an elephant   | 2 × 10⁶ kg        |
| Mass of a football    | 4 × 10⁻¹ m        |
| Length of a car       | 2 m               |
| Distance from Earth to sun | 1.52 × 10⁸ m   |
| Diameter of an atom   | 3 × 10⁻⁰ m        |
| Human life expectancy | 2 × 10⁹ s         |
| Orbit period of the moon | 2 × 10⁶ s      |

## KNOWLEDGE CHECK

Consider these EXAM-STYLE QUESTIONS below. After reflecting on these questions, click the FEEDBACK and EXPLANATION tabs to reveal the suggested answers. (Note: The feedback and explanation are provided below in the Answer/Explanation fields where available from the source document).

**Question:** In the following list, underline all the units that are SI base units.
ampere coulomb metre newton
**Options:**
- ampere
- coulomb
- metre
- newton
**Answer:** Ampere and metre
**Explanation:** Coulomb and newton are derived units which are made up of one or more of the S.I. base units.

**Activity/Question 2:**
**Question:** State the SI base units of volume.
